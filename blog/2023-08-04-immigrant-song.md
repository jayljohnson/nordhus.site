# Immigrant Song

> We come from the land of the ice and snow
> From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

*from Immigrant Song, by Led Zeppelin.  Page/Plant*

When my Norwegian ancestors immigrated to the US, they left with the surname Nordhus.  When they went through immigration processing their surname was changed to Johnson.  I picked the name Nordhus for my personal blog as an appreciation of those roots.  Johnson is the [2nd most common surname in the U.S](https://www.thoughtco.com/most-common-us-surnames-1422656).

Over a few generations, they made their way to Minnesota, and my paternal grandfather moved the family to Alaska where my father was born.  I was later born there too.  

I'm a fan of Led Zeppelin and the lyrics above resonated with me because they describe parts of the place where I grew up.  The midnight sun was wonderful to play in as a kid.  A couple decades after hearing that song that for the first time, I read the lyrics and realized that it is actually about Norse culture and mythology.

I recently got into a geneology rabbit hole, and came to appreciate how my place in life was shaped by a stream of immigrants from about a dozen now countries.  They left home for many reasons, and many of them probably never saw their motherland again.  The U.S. is a nation of immigrants and it's important to remeber those roots.  We live on Native land.
