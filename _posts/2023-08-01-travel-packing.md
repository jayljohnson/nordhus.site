## Essentials for travel
Things to pack for travel in Latin America, or really anywhere.

This is a working list that will be updated over time.

### Toiletries 
Not every public bathroom has these things
- liquid hand soap
- hand sanitizer
- toilette paper or wipes

### Medication and suppliments
Travelers diarrhea is awful and very real
- Immodium or other anti-diarrhea medication.  Because, it can happen at the worst possible time.
- Probiotic supplement to help restore gut health
- Electrolyte powder for rehydration.  Coconut water can work in a pinch, preferably green (young) coconuts which have less fat content.
